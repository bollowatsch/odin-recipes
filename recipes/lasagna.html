    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can
      also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground
      meats
      and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and
      spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in
        crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
        seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring
        occasionally.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
        minutes.
        Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley,
        and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
        lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella
        cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat
        layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either
        spray
        foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes
        before serving.</li>
    </ol>
